Welcome to Empower Muslim Women, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping Muslim women residing in Canada obtain legal divorce. We understand that divorce is a difficult and emotional process, and it can be even more challenging for Muslim women who may face cultural or religious barriers when seeking a divorce.

Our mission is to provide resources and support to Muslim women navigating the legal process of divorce in Canada. We believe that every woman has the right to a safe and healthy marriage, and if that is not possible, she deserves the legal and emotional support necessary to move on.

We are seeking to add a directory of professionals, including lawyers and counselors, who are committed to helping Muslim women through every step of the divorce process. If you are interested in listing your services please reach out to us using our Contact Us form. 

At Empower Muslim Women, we are dedicated to breaking down the barriers that prevent Muslim women from accessing the resources they need to obtain legal divorce. We believe that by empowering women and providing them with the right tools, we can help them move forward with confidence and independence.

Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope that you find the resources and support you need to make informed decisions about your future.
